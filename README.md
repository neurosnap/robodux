# robodux [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/neurosnap/robodux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/neurosnap/robodux)

- [Documentation](/docs/README.md)
- [API reference](/docs/api.md)

One of the biggest complaints developers have with redux is the amount of
boilerplate and new concepts they have to learn to use it. By using the
`robodux` pattern the amount of redux boilerplate is dramatically reduced. In
most cases, wiring up action types, action creators, and reducers can be done in
one line of code.

## Features

- A reusable pattern to build actions and reducers
- Slice helpers that create action types, action creators, and a reducer for
  common data structures (map, list, assign, and loading)
- Reducers leverage [immer](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer) which makes
  updating state easy
- When stringifying action creators they return the action type
- Reducers do not receive entire action object, only payload
- Low level functions to build your own slices, actions, and reducers

## Core principles

While many of the utilities built in this library mimic that of
[redux-toolkit](https://github.com/redux/redux-toolkit) the philosophy behind
how someone should use them are different.

The overriding principle is that effects (like sagas) should be the central
processing unit for all business logic in a react/redux application. We should
remove as much business logic as possible from reducers and instead centralize
them inside of our side-effect handlers.

Please see [style-guide](https://github.com/neurosnap/robodux) for more details.

## Why not `redux-toolkit`?

This library was heavily inspired by
[autodux](https://github.com/ericelliott/autodux) and
[redux-toolkit](https://github.com/redux/redux-toolkit). The reason why I
decided to create a separate library was primarily for:

- no external dependencies besides `immer`
- slice helpers
- philosophical differences

At this point in time, the primary benefit to use `robodux` over
`redux-starter-kit` is to leverage slice helpers. `redux-toolkit` is also trying
to be opinionated about how people should use it. The driving motivation for
`redux-toolkit` is to be able to install it and nothing else to get redux setup
with minimal boilerplate. It accomplishes this goal by installing `redux` and
other dependencies and re-exports them. This is certainly welcome for many
developers, however, `robodux` isn't trying to supersede `redux`. Instead, the
goal of `robodux` is to be an addition to `redux` in a non-intrusive manner and
to build scalable applications by using a set of repeatable functions that store
commonly used data structures in `redux`. `redux-toolkit` still recommends
`redux-thunk` for most applications which is a poor choice for managing
side-effects in a `redux` application and should only be used for very simple
applications.

Redux wants reducers to be the star of the application. This library
de-emphasizes `redux` and heavily emphasizes side-effect libraries like
`redux-saga`.
